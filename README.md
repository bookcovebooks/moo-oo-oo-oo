## About This Book

At a roaring city intersection, an Irish immigrant traffic officer nurtures a quiet, impossible fascination with a refined young woman who passes his post each day in a gleaming roadster. Bound by class, uniform, and self-doubt, he contents himself with fleeting smiles and imagined worlds far beyond his reach. But when an unexpected urban disruption shatters routine, the distance between them narrows in ways neither anticipates. Blending gentle humor with tender social insight, this early twentieth-century tale explores dignity, longing, and the surprising grace found in everyday encounters.
